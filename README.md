# CityCatch
This is the repository containing the code for the Final Project of the exam Mobile Application and Cloud Computing.

## General Idea:
Our project features a map on the user's device that highlights points of interest near their current location. By visiting these points the user can take a photo and gain some points. The user's score is based on the number of other people who have taken a photo of the same location. Clearly, a famous place will give less points. In this way, users are encouraged to explore new a less knonw locations. 
Users will be able to see all the photos taken in their user page and they will be able to see their global ranking in the Leaderboard page.

## Architecture:
